# Czenglish Dictionary, DEPRECATED

⚠️ Firefox now suppports spell-checking multiple languages simultaneously since [Firefox 100](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/100.0/releasenotes/) (released May 2022). Right click in a text input, Languages, you can now select multiple languages. That makes this Czenglish dictionary pretty much useless. It took only [21 years](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69687).

---

A Dictionary combining English and Czech. Useful when you use both languages and do not want to switch between them.

## Installation
- Clone this repo
- Go to `about:addons` in Firefox
- Select Install Add-on From File...
- Select the `ja@example.cz.xpi` file
- Maybe you will need to restart Firefox

This should work with MySpell too. Just copy `dictionaries/ja.dic` and `dictionaries/ja.aff` to `/usr/share/myspell`.

## Why does it use Japanese?
It's just a random ISO 639 language code.
