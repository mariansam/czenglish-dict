A Dictionary combining English and Czech. Useful when you use both languages and do not want to switch between them.

## Installation
- Clone this repo
- Go to `about:addons` in Firefox
- Select Install Add-on From File...
- Select the `ja@example.cz.xpi` file

This should work with MySpell too. Just copy `dictionaries/ja.dic` and `dictionaries/ja.aff` to `/usr/share/myspell`.

## Why does it use Japanese?
It's just a random ISO 639 language code.
